//to check if i have correctly installed nodeJS and npm by checking their version:
node -v

//to check version of newman
newman -v

if i want to run a collection in newman
newman run .path.to.collection.or.postman.API.collection.link

if i want to add environment after the path or link i add --envinronment .path.or.link

in jenkins i can make use of reporters, which jenkins can read and use for generating reporters (json,cli,junit,html). it goes like this:
-- reporters cli,junit (no spaces between)
and if i want to export the xml with reported data i use
--reporter-junit-export "path/for/file.xml" (example newman/report.xml)

there is an better html reporter called htmlextra, it's needed to install it before exeution on server with jenkins by
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra

when i want to upload file with collection in newman, i must manually change json collection file, line with "src"

i can set global variables in newman CLI usoing--global-var "exampleVarName=ExampleValue"
